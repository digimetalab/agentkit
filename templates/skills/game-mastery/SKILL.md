│
├── Nostalgic / Retro
│   ├── Limited palette? → Pixel Art
│   └── Hand-drawn feel? → Vector / Flash style
│
├── Realistic / Immersive
│   ├── High budget? → PBR 3D
│   └── Stylized realism? → Hand-painted textures
│
├── Approachable / Casual
│   ├── Clean shapes? → Flat / Minimalist
│   └── Soft feel? → Gradient / Soft shadows
│
└── Unique / Experimental
    └── Define custom style guide
```

### Style Comparison Matrix

| Style | Production Speed | Skill Floor | Scalability | Best For |
|-------|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Pixel Art** | Medium | Medium | Hard to hire | Indie, retro |
| **Vector/Flat** | Fast | Low | Easy | Mobile, casual |
| **Hand-painted** | Slow | High | Medium | Fantasy, stylized |
| **PBR 3D** | Slow | High | AAA pipeline | Realistic games |
| **Low-poly** | Fast | Medium | Easy | Indie 3D |
| **Cel-shaded** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Anime, cartoon |

---

## 2. Asset Pipeline Decisions

### 2D Pipeline

| Phase | Tool Options | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Concept** | Paper, Procreate, Photoshop | Reference sheet |
| **Creation** | Aseprite, Photoshop, Krita | Individual sprites |
| **Atlas** | TexturePacker, Aseprite | Spritesheet |
| **Animation** | Spine, DragonBones, Frame-by-frame | Animation data |
| **Integration** | Engine import | Game-ready assets |

### 3D Pipeline

| Phase | Tool Options | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Concept** | 2D art, Blockout | Reference |
| **Modeling** | Blender, Maya, 3ds Max | High-poly mesh |
| **Retopology** | Blender, ZBrush | Game-ready mesh |
| **UV/Texturing** | Substance Painter, Blender | Texture maps |
| **Rigging** | Blender, Maya | Skeletal rig |
| **Animation** | Blender, Maya, Mixamo | Animation clips |
| **Export** | FBX, glTF | Engine-ready |

---

## 3. Color Theory Decisions

### Palette Selection

| Goal | Strategy | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Harmony** | Complementary or analogous | Nature games |
| **Contrast** | High saturation differences | Action games |
| **Mood** | Warm/cool temperature | Horror, cozy |
| **Readability** | Value contrast over hue | Gameplay clarity |

### Color Principles

- **Hierarchy:** Important elements should pop
- **Consistency:** Same object = same color family
- **Context:** Colors read differently on backgrounds
- **Accessibility:** Don't rely only on color

---

## 4. Animation Principles

### The 12 Principles (Applied to Games)

| Principle | Game Application |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Squash & Stretch** | Jump arcs, impacts |
| **Anticipation** | Wind-up before attack |
| **Staging** | Clear silhouettes |
| **Follow-through** | Hair, capes after movement |
| **Slow in/out** | Easing on transitions |
| **Arcs** | Natural movement paths |
| **Secondary Action** | Breathing, blinking |
| **Timing** | Frame count = weight/speed |
| **Exaggeration** | Readable from distance |
| **Appeal** | Memorable design |

### Frame Count Guidelines

| Action Type | Typical Frames | Feel |
|-------------|----------------|------|
| Idle breathing | 4-8 | Subtle |
| Walk cycle | 6-12 | Smooth |
| Run cycle | 4-8 | Energetic |
| Attack | 3-6 | Snappy |
| Death | 8-16 | Dramatic |

---

## 5. Resolution & Scale Decisions

### 2D Resolution by Platform

| Platform | Base Resolution | Sprite Scale |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Mobile | 1080p | 64-128px characters |
| Desktop | 1080p-4K | 128-256px characters |
| Pixel art | 320x180 to 640x360 | 16-32px characters |

### Consistency Rule

Choose a base unit and stick to it:
- Pixel art: Work at 1x, scale up (never down)
- HD art: Define DPI, maintain ratio
- 3D: 1 unit = 1 meter (industry standard)

---

## 6. Asset Organization

### Naming Convention

```
[type]_[object]_[variant]_[state].[ext]

Examples:
spr_player_idle_01.png
tex_stone_wall_normal.png
mesh_tree_oak_lod2.fbx
```

### Folder Structure Principle

```
assets/
├── characters/
│   ├── player/
│   └── enemies/
├── environment/
│   ├── props/
│   └── tiles/
├── ui/
├── effects/
└── audio/
```

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Mix art styles randomly | Define and follow style guide |
| Work at final resolution only | Create at source resolution |
| Ignore silhouette readability | Test at gameplay distance |
| Over-detail background | Focus detail on player area |
| Skip color testing | Test on target display |

---

> **Remember:** Art serves gameplay. If it doesn't help the player, it's decoration.


--- SECTION: GAME-AUDIO ---


# Game Audio Principles

> Sound design and music integration for immersive game experiences.

---

## 1. Audio Category System

### Category Definitions

| Category | Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Music** | Looping, crossfade, ducking | BGM, combat music |
| **SFX** | One-shot, 3D positioned | Footsteps, impacts |
| **Ambient** | Looping, background layer | Wind, crowd, forest |
| **UI** | Immediate, non-3D | Button clicks, notifications |
| **Voice** | Priority, ducking trigger | Dialogue, announcer |

### Priority Hierarchy

```
When sounds compete for channels:

1. Voice (highest - always audible)
2. Player SFX (feedback critical)
3. Enemy SFX (gameplay important)
4. Music (mood, but duckable)
5. Ambient (lowest - can drop)
```

---

## 2. Sound Design Decisions

### SFX Creation Approach

| Approach | When to Use | Trade-offs |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Recording** | Realistic needs | High quality, time intensive |
| **Synthesis** | Sci-fi, retro, UI | Unique, requires skill |
| **Library samples** | Fast production | Common sounds, licensing |
| **Layering** | Complex sounds | Best results, more work |

### Layering Structure

| Layer | Purpose | Example: Gunshot |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Attack** | Initial transient | Click, snap |
| **Body** | Main character | Boom, blast |
| **Tail** | Decay, room | Reverb, echo |
| **Sweetener** | Special sauce | Shell casing, mechanical |

---

## 3. Music Integration

### Music State System

```
Game State → Music Response
│
├── Menu → Calm, loopable theme
├── Exploration → Ambient, atmospheric
├── Combat detected → Transition to tension
├── Combat engaged → Full battle music
├── Victory → Stinger + calm transition
├── Defeat → Somber stinger
└── Boss → Unique, multi-phase track
```

### Transition Techniques

| Technique | Use When | Feel |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Crossfade** | Smooth mood shift | Gradual |
| **Stinger** | Immediate event | Dramatic |
| **Stem mixing** | Dynamic intensity | Seamless |
| **Beat-synced** | Rhythmic gameplay | Musical |
| **Queue point** | Next natural break | Clean |

---

## 4. Adaptive Audio Decisions

### Intensity Parameters

| Parameter | Affects | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Threat level** | Music intensity | Enemy count |
| **Health** | Filter, reverb | Low health = muffled |
| **Speed** | Tempo, energy | Racing speed |
| **Environment** | Reverb, EQ | Cave vs outdoor |
| **Time of day** | Mood, volume | Night = quieter |

### Vertical vs Horizontal

| System | What Changes | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Vertical (layers)** | Add/remove instrument layers | Intensity scaling |
| **Horizontal (segments)** | Different music sections | State changes |
| **Combined** | Both | AAA adaptive scores |

---

## 5. 3D Audio Decisions

### Spatialization

| Element | 3D Positioned? | Reason |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Player footsteps | No (or subtle) | Always audible |
| Enemy footsteps | Yes | Directional awareness |
| Gunfire | Yes | Combat awareness |
| Music | No | Mood, non-diegetic |
| Ambient zone | Yes (area) | Environmental |
| UI sounds | No | Interface feedback |

### Distance Behavior

| Distance | Sound Behavior |
|----------|----------------|
| **Near** | Full volume, full frequency |
| **Medium** | Volume falloff, high-freq rolloff |
| **Far** | Low volume, low-pass filter |
| **Max** | Silent or ambient hint |

---

## 6. Platform Considerations

### Format Selection

| Platform | Recommended Format | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| PC | OGG Vorbis, WAV | Quality, no licensing |
| Console | Platform-specific | Certification |
| Mobile | MP3, AAC | Size, compatibility |
| Web | WebM/Opus, MP3 fallback | Browser support |

### Memory Budget

| Game Type | Audio Budget | Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Mobile casual | 10-50 MB | Compressed, fewer variants |
| PC indie | 100-500 MB | Quality focus |
| AAA | 1+ GB | Full quality, many variants |

---

## 7. Mix Hierarchy

### Volume Balance Reference

| Category | Relative Level | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Voice** | 0 dB (reference) | Always clear |
| **Player SFX** | -3 to -6 dB | Prominent but not harsh |
| **Music** | -6 to -12 dB | Foundation, ducks for voice |
| **Enemy SFX** | -6 to -9 dB | Important but not dominant |
| **Ambient** | -12 to -18 dB | Subtle background |

### Ducking Rules

| When | Duck What | Amount |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Voice plays | Music, Ambient | -6 to -9 dB |
| Explosion | All except explosion | Brief duck |
| Menu open | Gameplay audio | -3 to -6 dB |

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Play same sound repeatedly | Use variations (3-5 per sound) |
| Max volume everything | Use proper mix hierarchy |
| Ignore silence | Silence creates contrast |
| One music track loops forever | Provide variety, transitions |
| Skip audio in prototype | Placeholder audio matters |

---

> **Remember:** 50% of the game experience is audio. A muted game loses half its soul.


--- SECTION: GAME-DESIGN ---


# Game Design Principles

> Design thinking for engaging games.

---

## 1. Core Loop Design

### The 30-Second Test

```
Every game needs a fun 30-second loop:
1. ACTION → Player does something
2. FEEDBACK → Game responds
3. REWARD → Player feels good
4. REPEAT
```

### Loop Examples

| Genre | Core Loop |
|-------|-----------|
| Platformer | Run → Jump → Land → Collect |
| Shooter | Aim → Shoot → Kill → Loot |
| Puzzle | Observe → Think → Solve → Advance |
| RPG | Explore → Fight → Level → Gear |

---

## 2. Game Design Document (GDD)

### Essential Sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pitch** | One-sentence description |
| **Core Loop** | 30-second gameplay |
| **Mechanics** | How systems work |
| **Progression** | How player advances |
| **Art Style** | Visual direction |
| **Audio** | Sound direction |

### Principles

- Keep it living (update regularly)
- Visuals help communicate
- Less is more (start small)

---

## 3. Player Psychology

### Motivation Types

| Type | Driven By |
|------|-----------|
| **Achiever** | Goals, completion |
| **Explorer** | Discovery, secrets |
| **Socializer** | Interaction, community |
| **Killer** | Competition, dominance |

### Reward Schedules

| Schedule | Effect | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Fixed** | Predictable | Milestone rewards |
| **Variable** | Addictive | Loot drops |
| **Ratio** | Effort-based | Grind games |

---

## 4. Difficulty Balancing

### Flow State

```
Too Hard → Frustration → Quit
Too Easy → Boredom → Quit
Just Right → Flow → Engagement
```

### Balancing Strategies

| Strategy | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Dynamic** | Adjust to player skill |
| **Selection** | Let player choose |
| **Accessibility** | Options for all |

---

## 5. Progression Design

### Progression Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Skill** | Player gets better |
| **Power** | Character gets stronger |
| **Content** | New areas unlock |
| **Story** | Narrative advances |

### Pacing Principles

- Early wins (hook quickly)
- Gradually increase challenge
- Rest beats between intensity
- Meaningful choices

---

## 6. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Design in isolation | Playtest constantly |
| Polish before fun | Prototype first |
| Force one way to play | Allow player expression |
| Punish excessively | Reward progress |

---

> **Remember:** Fun is discovered through iteration, not designed on paper.


--- SECTION: GAME-DEVELOPMENT ---


# Game Development

> **Orchestrator skill** that provides core principles and routes to specialized sub-skills.

---

## When to Use This Skill

You are working on a game development project. This skill teaches the PRINCIPLES of game development and directs you to the right sub-skill based on context.

---

## Sub-Skill Routing

### Platform Selection

| If the game targets... | Use Sub-Skill |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Web browsers (HTML5, WebGL) | `game-development/web-games` |
| Mobile (iOS, Android) | `game-development/mobile-games` |
| PC (Steam, Desktop) | `game-development/pc-games` |
| VR/AR headsets | `game-development/vr-ar` |

### Dimension Selection

| If the game is... | Use Sub-Skill |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 2D (sprites, tilemaps) | `game-development/2d-games` |
| 3D (meshes, shaders) | `game-development/3d-games` |

### Specialty Areas

| If you need... | Use Sub-Skill |
|----------------|---------------|
| GDD, balancing, player psychology | `game-development/game-design` |
| Multiplayer, networking | `game-development/multiplayer` |
| Visual style, asset pipeline, animation | `game-development/game-art` |
| Sound design, music, adaptive audio | `game-development/game-audio` |

---

## Core Principles (All Platforms)

### 1. The Game Loop

Every game, regardless of platform, follows this pattern:

```
INPUT  → Read player actions
UPDATE → Process game logic (fixed timestep)
RENDER → Draw the frame (interpolated)
```

**Fixed Timestep Rule:**
- Physics/logic: Fixed rate (e.g., 50Hz)
- Rendering: As fast as possible
- Interpolate between states for smooth visuals

---

### 2. Pattern Selection Matrix

| Pattern | Use When | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **State Machine** | 3-5 discrete states | Player: Idle→Walk→Jump |
| **Object Pooling** | Frequent spawn/destroy | Bullets, particles |
| **Observer/Events** | Cross-system communication | Health→UI updates |
| **ECS** | Thousands of similar entities | RTS units, particles |
| **Command** | Undo, replay, networking | Input recording |
| **Behavior Tree** | Complex AI decisions | Enemy AI |

**Decision Rule:** Start with State Machine. Add ECS only when performance demands.

---

### 3. Input Abstraction

Abstract input into ACTIONS, not raw keys:

```
"jump"  → Space, Gamepad A, Touch tap
"move"  → WASD, Left stick, Virtual joystick
```

**Why:** Enables multi-platform, rebindable controls.

---

### 4. Performance Budget (60 FPS = 16.67ms)

| System | Budget |
|--------|--------|
| Input | 1ms |
| Physics | 3ms |
| AI | 2ms |
| Game Logic | 4ms |
| Rendering | 5ms |
| Buffer | 1.67ms |

**Optimization Priority:**
1. Algorithm (O(n²) → O(n log n))
2. Batching (reduce draw calls)
3. Pooling (avoid GC spikes)
4. LOD (detail by distance)
5. Culling (skip invisible)

---

### 5. AI Selection by Complexity

| AI Type | Complexity | Use When |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **FSM** | Simple | 3-5 states, predictable behavior |
| **Behavior Tree** | Medium | Modular, designer-friendly |
| **GOAP** | High | Emergent, planning-based |
| **Utility AI** | High | Scoring-based decisions |

---

### 6. Collision Strategy

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **AABB** | Rectangles, fast checks |
| **Circle** | Round objects, cheap |
| **Spatial Hash** | Many similar-sized objects |
| **Quadtree** | Large worlds, varying sizes |

---

## Anti-Patterns (Universal)

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Update everything every frame | Use events, dirty flags |
| Create objects in hot loops | Object pooling |
| Cache nothing | Cache references |
| Optimize without profiling | Profile first |
| Mix input with logic | Abstract input layer |

---

## Routing Examples

### Example 1: "I want to make a browser-based 2D platformer"
→ Start with `game-development/web-games` for framework selection
→ Then `game-development/2d-games` for sprite/tilemap patterns
→ Reference `game-development/game-design` for level design

### Example 2: "Mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android"
→ Start with `game-development/mobile-games` for touch input and stores
→ Use `game-development/game-design` for puzzle balancing

### Example 3: "Multiplayer VR shooter"
→ `game-development/vr-ar` for comfort and immersion
→ `game-development/3d-games` for rendering
→ `game-development/multiplayer` for networking

---

> **Remember:** Great games come from iteration, not perfection. Prototype fast, then polish.
